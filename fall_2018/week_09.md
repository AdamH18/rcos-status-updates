## Last Week's Accomplishments

Last week I found a good library to use to program diffusion maps in Python and begun to mess
around with it and work on the tutorials. Once I have a better understanding of how to use this
I'll be able to move forwards on this part of the project.

## This Week's Plan

Run through the tutorials on the pydiffmap library in order to learn how it works. It provides
tutorials and datasets to use on those tutorials, which is very useful for me. I also still need
to look into methods of encoding meter and rhyme.

## Anything Blocking?

Nope

## Notes

None
