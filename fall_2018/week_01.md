## Last Week's Accomplishments

Set up Keras and Tensorflow on desktop computer, started to look at LSTM with words tutorial but ran
into an issue with that because Keras doesn't like a type of character in the dataset.

## This Week's Plan

Finish the tutorial, meet with the team on Wednesday to plan out future development.

## Anything Blocking?

Need to figure out why Keras doesn't like the character in the Alice and Wonderland dataset in order
to run the tutorial.

## Notes
