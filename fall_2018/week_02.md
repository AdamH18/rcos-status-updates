## Last Week's Accomplishments

Confirmed that LSTM tutorial code works on my machine and ran it on a small dataset. Met with Jon and gained
some further direction for the project and learned about LSTMs.

## This Week's Plan

Figure out how to get some data for rap lyrics from a specific artist, then run the LSTM tutorial code
on the rap lyric dataset.

## Anything Blocking?

Need to find a method to gather huge quantities of song lyrics from specific artists.

## Notes
