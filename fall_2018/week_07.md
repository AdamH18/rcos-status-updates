## Last Week's Accomplishments

I met with Jon to talk about where I'm headed with my project. I gained a better understanding of
where my work will fit in with the general project, specifically my diffusion map will be able
to encode huge amounts of data about the meaning, meter, and rhyme of the words in a song into a
relatively small dimension that will then be a better dataset for the machine learning algorithms
to run on.

## This Week's Plan

Gather some data to mess around with diffusion maps to gain a better intuitive understanding of how
they work. I also need to look into methods people have come up with of encoding meter and rhyme in
order to implement this myself.

## Anything Blocking?

Nope
