## Last Week's Accomplishments

Talked with Jon and will now be working on diffusion maps for the project, so I started to
learn about similar dimensionality reduction techniques to gain the background necessary to
know what I'm doing.

## This Week's Plan

Meet with Jon again to talk about specifics for my part of the project and learn more about
diffusion maps.

## Anything Blocking?

Nope
