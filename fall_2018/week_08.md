## Last Week's Accomplishments

As last week was Thanksgiving break, I did not spend much time on RCOS. I spent a small amount of time
looking into locations where I will be able to find datasets to test diffusion maps on, as I need large
sample datasets to get a decent idea of how diffusion maps work and how to use them. I also began to
find techniques for meter and rhyme encoding that use a similar idea as word2vec.

## This Week's Plan

As I did not do much work last week, my plan for this week is the same: Gather some data to mess
around with diffusion maps to gain a better intuitive understanding of how they work. I also need
to look into methods people have come up with of encoding meter and rhyme in order to implement
this myself.

## Anything Blocking?

Nope
