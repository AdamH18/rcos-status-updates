## Last Week's Accomplishments

> I managed to create the dataset of vectors of the amount each note is played over a measure interval \
> and apply PCA to it to take a look at the data. I met with our project lead and discussed next steps.

## This Week's Plan

> The next plan is to try to implement a naive method of finding the correct measure intervals using \
> cosine difference between vectors that determine the direction of the PCA of the music. We found that \
> at the correct intervals there was often a drastic change in the direction of the data so this should \
> work decently well.

## Anything Blocking?

> None

## Notes

> This is an optional section for any sort of information that does not fall under any of the other categories.
