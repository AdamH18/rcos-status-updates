## Last Week's Accomplishments

> This past week I didn't get much done as I was waiting for code I would work on to be uploaded to Github.

## This Week's Plan

> I plan on working on the code that I now have access to on Github. In particular, I will be building a dataset \
> out of a MIDI file that will consist of vectors of the amount each note is played over a measure interval.

## Anything Blocking?

> No blockers as I haven't gotten to work yet and don't know if I'll run into issues.

## Notes

> This is an optional section for any sort of information that does not fall under any of the other categories.
