## Last Week's Accomplishments

> I implemented the naive method as discussed and found that it wasn't a phenomenal method for grouping \
> the data as we hoped it would be. I met with the team lead and we discussed next steps.

## This Week's Plan

> The project lead found an interesting paper on finding where time based data changes, so I need to read \
> that paper and begin thinking about new ways forward. As well as this, I need to fix something with my \
> naive method to remove all the nans from cosine distance.

## Anything Blocking?

> None

## Notes

> This is an optional section for any sort of information that does not fall under any of the other categories.
